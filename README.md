# E-Commerce App - Flutter UI


In the first part of our e-commerce app, we show you how you can create a nice clean Splash screen for your e-commerce app that can run both Andriod and iOS devices because it builds with flutter. Then on the second episode, we build a Sign in with custom error indicator. The third Episode contains Sign Up screen. The fourth episode is the most exciting episode because we build our home page on this episode than on the fifth episode we work on our product page, 
and on the sixth we work on our Add to Cart page which has some cool stuff like swipe to remove products and seventh we build an order screen with error indicators, last not least on the 8th episode we build an confirm order screen.
